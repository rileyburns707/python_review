# Overview
I wanted to refresh my Python skills in order to break any bad habits I created and to reteach myself the fundamentals I have forgetten. I followed an online course that went over everything from defining variables to creating projects using APIs.
I was surprised at how much of the simple things I had forgot and by how beneficial this journey would be. I ended up taking detailed notes all on a Google Collab before switching to VS Code to do the more indept projects.
I am very happy I took the time to do this, even though it was incredibly tedious, because now I am extremely confident in my foundation of Python and I can already see this paying off as I continue to work on larger projects.
