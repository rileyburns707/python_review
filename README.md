# Overview
I wanted to refresh my Python skills in order to break any bad habits I created and to reteach myself the fundamentals I have forgetten. I followed an online course that went over everything from defining variables to creating projects using APIs.
I was surprised at how much of the simple things I had forgot and by how beneficial this journey would be. I ended up taking detailed notes all on a Google Colab before switching to VS Code to do the more indept projects.
I am very happy I took the time to do this, even though it was incredibly tedious, because now I am extremely confident in my foundation of Python and I can already see this paying off as I continue to work on larger projects.

## File Breakdown
The "Weather App" and "Hangman Game" are the 2 projects I decided to do, and the rest of the files are self titled on the topics I covered during a lesson. The Colab notebook file is a breakdown explain various topics starting at while loops.

For the more basic topics I took handwritten notes so I did not upload those, but here is a list of what I covered
  * Variables
  * Typecasting
  * User Input
  * Arithmetic & Math
  * if Statements
  * Logical Operators
  * Conditional Expressions
  * String Methods
  * String Indexing
  * Format Specifiers
